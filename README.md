# Getting and Cleaning Data: Programming Assignment


This repository contains programming assignment files for Coursera course "Getting and Cleaning Data", part of the Data Science specialization. 

## run_analysis.R

This R script downloads the raw data and processes into a tidy data set. The output is a text file, 'uci-har-tidy-data.txt', containing the average standard deviation and mean values for each combination of activity and subject in the raw dataset.

## CodeBook.md

The Code Book describes the variables in data set, the way data is summarized, and the method used to clean up the data.  

## Raw Data

The raw data comes from the smartphone accelerometer and gyroscope 3-axial raw signals, 
which have been processed using various signal processing techniques to measurement vector consisting of 561 features. [This site](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones) describes the raw data in more detail. 

Raw data is stored in the "./data/UCI HAR Dataset/" directory.
